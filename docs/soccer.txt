I have been playing football (or soccer) since I was 6 and I have been captain of the Under-19, the Under-16 teams in my small town, Montecosaro and I also have been captain in the first of another town, Loro Piceno, at the age of 21, leading youngsters and more experienced players in Terza categoria.

In the last year I played amatorial 7-a-side football with an oratorio close to my house in Milan.

I play as a center back and I strongly support AC Milan.
