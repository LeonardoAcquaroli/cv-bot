I play the guitar and everday I listen to different musical genres.
My favorite ones are Punk rock, Alternative rock and Hard rock and my favorite bands is Green day.

Yet I'm also used to sing on Maneskin's, Daft punk's and Ed Sheeran's songs among the others.

I prefer to play my cherry red electric guitar but in Milan I only have my acoustic one.
